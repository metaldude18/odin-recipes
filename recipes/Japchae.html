    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil; stir in noodles and return to a boil. Cook noodles uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 5 minutes. Drain and rinse with cold water.</li>
            <li>Toss noodles with 2 teaspoons sesame oil. Cut into shorter pieces using kitchen shears.</li>
            <li>Combine soy sauce and sugar in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Saute carrots and onion until soft, about 1 minute. Add mushrooms, green onions, and garlic. Saute until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the noodles, soy sauce mixture, and spinach. </li>
            <li>Cook and stir until noodles are heated through, 2 to 3 minutes more. Remove from heat. Toss in remaining 1 tablespoon sesame oil and sesame seeds.</li>
        </ol>
