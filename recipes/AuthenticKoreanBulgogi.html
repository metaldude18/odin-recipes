    <h2>What the heck is Bulgogi?</h2>
        <p>Bulgogi is a Korean dish that literally means <em>fire meat</em>. 
        It can be grilled or roasted and typically is made of thinly sliced and marinated beef or pork.
        Often bulgogi is stir-fried in a pan at home if outdoor grilling is not possible. Rice or noodles 
        and vegetables are also usually served with it.</p>
