    <h2>What the heck is Kimbop?</h2>
        <p>Kimbop is Korean sushi using dried seaweed as a wrap rolled with assorted ingredients. It always has rice rolled with some combination of vegetables and meats.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>    
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup uncooked glutinous white rice (sushi rice)</li>
                <li>1½ cups water </li>
                <li>salt, to taste </li>
                <li>2 eggs, beaten </li>
                <li>¼ cup soy sauce</li>
                <li>4 sheets sushi nori (dry seaweed)</li>
                <li>1 tablespoons Asian sesame oil</li>
                <li>1 cucumber, cut into thin strips</li>
                <li>1 carrot, cut into thin strips</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon sesame seeds</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons sesame oil</li>
                <li>half lb of already cooked beef</li>
            </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Rinse the rice in a strainer or colander until the water runs clear. Combine the rice with water in a saucepan. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low; cover and simmer until rice is tender, 12 to 14 minutes. Spread cooked rice onto a baking sheet to cool. Season with 1 tablespoon of sesame oil and salt.</li>
            <li>While the rice is simmering, pour the eggs into a skillet over medium-high heat and allow to cook without stirring or turning to get a flat layer of cooked egg. When egg is completely cooked, remove from skillet and set aside on a cutting board to cool.</li>
            <li>Separate the nori sheets onto a flat surface and divide the cooled rice between them, leaving only a half-inch strip of seaweed visible at the top of each sheet. Arrange strips of egg, cucumber, carrot, and beef in thin layers on top of the rice. </li>
            <li>Beginning with the bottom of each sheet of nori, use a bamboo sushi mat to firmly roll each piece into a cylindrical shape. Brush each roll with 1/2 teaspoon of sesame oil and cut into six even piecesOrange
